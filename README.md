# cpu-architecture-comparison
## Overview

This repository contains an exploration of stack-based and register-based CPU organizations. It discusses the fundamental operations, advantages, and disadvantages of each architecture, and provides an example of how arithmetic expressions are evaluated using Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) on a stack-based machine.

## Contents

stack_vs_register_cpu: A detailed comparison of stack-based and register-based CPU organizations, including examples and explanations.
rpn_example Step-by-step execution of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation on a stack-based machine.
pros_and_cons: A list of the pros and cons of both stack-based and register-based virtual machines.
